# What is Nissy?
Nissy is a tool for the Fewest Moves Challenge (FMC). It helps you find good EOs, DRs, and HTRs while using niss.

NISS stands for Normal Inverse Scramble Switch, and it is a very common technique for FMC. This tool is essentially a Rubik's Cube solver that can get you to a given state using niss.

Sebastiano Tronto created the original nissy that this website is based on. You can learn more here.

# Who should use Web Nissy?
Web Nissy is helpful for FMC solvers who want to improve their skills and verify whether their solution is efficient.

For example, you can put in a scramble and see if there are any good EOs that you missed. Or you can put in a scramble and a partial solution, then see what the best continuations are.
